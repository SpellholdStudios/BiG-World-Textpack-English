@0 = ~At last, we stand face to face, Malthis! I will finally absorb your essence in me!~ 
@1 = ~Your thirst for power is endless and your quest, hopeless! If I do not kill you, someone else will! No one is invincible!~
@2 = ~We shall see, Malthis... we shall! You cannot defeat me! There are too many of us, much more than you know! Even if by some miracle, you are victorious here, you will only delay your inevitable end.~ 
@3 = ~Your stupidity will lead us all to our deaths. So be it. Before blood flows, tell me, what are we?~ [MALTH35]
@4 = ~I thought Kern and Dindal told you everything? Blind fool! How you have survived for so long is a mystery to me! I will make it brief: We are the forerunners of vampires! We are ever powerful, ever evolving. We chose our paths, *evil* or *good*, ourselves and are shaped by our choices. We do not need blood, but it makes us stronger! Enough words. Knowledge of this world does not help the dead. Come, embrace your death!~
