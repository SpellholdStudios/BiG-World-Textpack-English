@1 = ~We have a problem, I wonder if you could help us...~ 
@2 = ~She is a vampire!(Where do all these vampires come from?) I... I see. You... have need of blood, I presume?  ~
@3 = ~I... I think I see your problem. She... one of your companions thirsts for blood, yes? (They must belong to the group that has taken up residence here)~ 
@4 = ~Yes, but I do not drink sentient blood, I need beast blood to slake my thirst.~
@5 = ~Yes, but she needs beast blood. She... shirks from killing people for food.~ 
@6 = ~There is no remedy unfortunately, but you can talk to Relaed. He stands there in the corner and trades in all kinds of items. Lately, there has been an increase in the demand for blood. Maybe he can help you...~
