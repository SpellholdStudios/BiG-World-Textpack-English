@1 = ~I am looking for something... specific... and unusual. Do you stock up on animal blood?~ 
@2 = ~What do you need beast blood for? You some weirdo? Doin' devil worship or somethin'?~
@3 = ~No, I need it so I won't suck your sweet succulent nectar out instead.~ 
@4 = ~I assure you, you do not want to see that. Or feel it for that matter.~
@5 = ~Uhhhh... yes... erhm, yes, I think, yes, I can definitely help you out there. I have some... some sacrificial blood. But it won't be cheap... the dark elves pay handsomely for them.~ 
@6 = ~Well, if... if it's that important to you...~
@7 = ~My companion needs it... to slake her thirst.~
@8 = ~People have strange taste... expensive tastes... well, to each his own. As long as I profit, I don't care what you do with it. Let's see what I have with me.~
