Chapter I: Introduction
-----------------------
Mod adds a new in-game NPC named Raziel. It is a neutral evil NPC, who like the main character was captured and imprisoned by Irenicus. It has its own unique portrait created by me.

Chapter II: Installation
-----------------------
BGII is required. Raziel NPC should work correctly with the majority WeiDU mods. It may also be compatible with non WeiDU-based mods, but was not tested in this regard. If you have problems on compatibility, please tell me.

Unload the main ZIP file to the folder where you have BGII. The is the default:
         C:\Program Files\Black Isle\BGII-SoA\

Run (double-click on) "Setup-Raziel.exe".

Then choose which components you want to install. All are optional. Later, you can always uninstall by clicking again on "Setup-Raziel.exe"

You need to start a new game for the changes to take effect.

Chapter III: Compatibility
----------------------------
Please inform me about problems with compatibility.

Chapter IV: FAQ
-----------------------
Q: Where is the hidden key to the cell Raziel?
A: You can find the key behind a painting in the room with the cell.
