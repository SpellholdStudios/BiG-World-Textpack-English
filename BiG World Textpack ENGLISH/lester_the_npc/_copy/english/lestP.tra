@0 = ~Hey?! Are you kicking me out? I promise I'll do the laundry and the dishes! I also bathe more often!~ 
@1 = ~Lester, you can stay with us, but under one condition, you will warn everyone before throwing up.~
@2 = ~No, you should leave. Go to the Copper Coronet, everyone there is always too drunk to notice your stench.~ 
@3 = ~Ho ho! By my donkey's fragrant arse, you're back. What's up? Do you need me again?~
@4 = ~Of course. Join us back.~ 
@5 = ~Not at this time. I'm still angry with you!~
