@0 = ~What is it, <CHARNAME>, do you want me to leave?~ 
@1 = ~No, no... please stay in the party.~
@2 = ~It is time we part ways.~ 
@3 = ~I never thought that I would see you again so soon, <CHARNAME>. Do you need me help?~
@4 = ~If you are interested, join me, Shar-Teel.~ 
@5 = ~I don't need your help right now.~
@6 = ~So be it. Let's wade into battle together! Into the river of blood of our enemies and may their cries of pain be our songs of tribute and triumph!~
@7 = ~If that is what you wish, <CHARNAME>... I have enjoyed myself in your company... you have always provided a steady stream of opponents. Farewell... maybe we will meet again, one day.~ 
@8 = ~I'll stay here for a while... at the Copper Coronet. It is not so bad. There is always something interesting going on, and there are plenty of fools, who need their teeth kicked in, and there's the arena...~
