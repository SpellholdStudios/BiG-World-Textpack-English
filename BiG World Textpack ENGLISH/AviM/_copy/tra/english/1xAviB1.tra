@0 = ~(A man, hard at work, steps away to rest and looks at the party.)~ 
@1 = ~Avi Maya?! But... but you're dead! I mean you died?! Wha-... I don't know why I am surprised to see you... nothing should surprise me anymore.~
@2 = ~There's no time to talk now. The priests here don't need to know that the undead are inside the temple. Pretend to be alive... or there will be trouble... Why are you here? Have you come to see Dost? I'm afraid he is not here anymore. He hasn't been here for quite sometime. Neither has Kania... Last I hear- (the man looks around, lowers his head and brings it closer.) Last I heard it was- Rumors, I- Something isn't right... I heard he was in Athkatla... You might find him there... You should not be here! Go, go now!~ 
@3 = ~(The man returns to his work.)~
@4 = ~Hmmm?~ 
@5 = ~I- We have the Dost's skull. He... he had become one of the undead... Is there anyway you can help? I beg you...~
@6 = ~This... this skull... is Dost?! I... I have studied necromancy... we can... we can bring him back to life. But you will have to sacrifice a part of yourself!~
